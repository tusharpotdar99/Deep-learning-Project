PROJECT TITLE : EMNIST HAND WRITING RECOGNITION USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK

Description : 
The project explores The Properties of Artificial Neural Networks, I built a simple Deep learning 
model to test the Emnist dataset can be used to Recognise The Handwritten digits and characters
which is in image format

Environment:
Tensorflow
Keras
Numpy
Pandas
Sklearn

Usage:
A Trained Model for Classifying EMNIST Dataset and Hand writing digits, Characters
